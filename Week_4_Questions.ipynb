    "### Q1. Estimating the height reached by a rocket\n",
    "\n",
    "The height above the groud of a rocket are as follows:\n",

    "0s -> 0.0 m\n",
    "\n",
    "0.05s -> 0.1m\n",
    "\n",

    "0.20s -> 1.55m\n",
    "\n",
    "0.25s -> 2.32m\n",
    "\n",
    "Your task is as follows. Use Astropy units for all steps and check that you get the desired dimensions.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Use a finite differences approach to estimate the acceleration of the object averaged over the first 0.25s.\n",
    "2. From the acceleration, use kinematics to calculate the height after 0.25s assuming it started at $h = 0m$, $v = 0m/s$ and a is constant as you found above.\n",
    "3. Now assume that the rocket shuts off after 0.25s. Calculate how high it would get given that it is now only experiencing acceleration from gravity.\n",
    "4. Check that the units from the calculations performed with Astropy match waht you expect.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hint: Put the numbers into an np array for the heights to do the finite differences. The time difference is the same between each data point (0.05s) so you can just store this rather than needing a list of all the times."
